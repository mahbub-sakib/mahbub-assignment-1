                <h3>Mission</h3>
                <p>Web designers generally have nothing to do with creating content for their projects. Even so, the
                    look of a site can be
                    incomplete if no words are included. Web designers need to find ways to incorporate copyright-free
                    content into their
                    designs to provide clients with a look that is as finished as possible.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="mission-box mbox2">
                <img src="images/illustrators/illustrator-2.png" alt="">
                <h3>Vision</h3>
                <p>Creating a prototype website that also contains copy and images is the only way to help the client
                    understand what the
                    concept behind your design is. Without these elements, the finished product can look quite odd, and
                    the client won’t be
                    able to mentally project his own content uploaded on the site.</p>

                <img src="images/illustrators/illustrator-3.png" alt="">
                <h3>Goals</h3>
                <p>Not all people can afford to pay for content immediately after creating their website, so that’s not
                    a condition you can
                    demand from your clients. Instead, you can use a dummy text generator. These generators will give
                    you bits of text that
                    are supposed to fill the blank spaces on the website that you are designing.</p>

            <h3>Without Limits</h3>
            <p>Dummy text refers to the bits of content that are used to fill a website mock-up. This text helps web
                designers better
                envision how the website will look as a finished product. It is important to understand that dummy text
                has no meaning
                whatsoever. Its sole purpose is to fill out blank spaces with “word-like” content, without making any
                copyright
                issue.</p>

            <p>Now you know what dummy text is, let’s learn about its usefulness. Some people say that they don’t need
                to use a dummy
                text generator to deliver a web design project to the customer. Even though this might be true, the
                effect that the
                final project will produce on the client won’t be as satisfactory as in the case of one with included
                filler content.</p>

                <p>A dummy text generator gives web designers the content they need. Then, they can use the typefaces
                    and
                    layout they
                    prefer, thus obtaining the best mock-up of their work. It would be best to be impossible to
                    understand
                    and read because
                    people might get distracted by the text itself and its nonsense rather than analyzing how the
                    typefaces
                    integrate into
                    the design instead.</p>
